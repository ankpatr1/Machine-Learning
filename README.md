**Course Description**

* The main objective of this course is to introduce students to machine learning, the study of
computer systems that improve their performance automatically through experience. Students
will learn the foundations of machine learning, together with the latest machine learning
algorithms and models that constitute typical machine learning systems. Students will gain the
background necessary to build practical machine learning systems and conduct research in
machine learning.

# Learning Outcomes

This course is designed to provide a solid foundation on the theoretical underpinnings of
machine learning and sufficient experience in developing machine learning algorithms for
practical use. In particular, upon successful completion of this course, 
the student will be able to:
• Develop an appreciation of the different components of the learning problem
• Understand what makes learning feasible
• Appreciate the challenges involved in building machine learning systems
• Understand a wide variety of machine learning algorithms
• Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning algorithms
• Employ sound strategies and best practices in the design of machine learning systems
• Design and implement machine learning systems to solve practical, real-world problems

# Main Topics

• Components of the (Supervised) Learning Problem.
• The Feasibility of Learning: Hoeffding’s Inequality.
• Training versus Testing: Vapnik-Chervonenkis Bound, Bias-Variance Tradeoff.
• The Linear Model for Classification (Perceptrons).
• Linear Regression.
• Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent.
• Overfitting and how to mitigate it. Regularization and Validation.

2
• (Deep) Neural Networks.
• Backpropagation.
• Support Vector Machines.
• The Kernal Trick.
• K-Nearest Neighbors.
• Decision Trees.
• Bagging and Boosting.
• Principal Component Analysis.
• Other Learning Paradigms: Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
• Introduction to Recent ML Research Problems.

# Credit Hours and Contact Hours
• Credit hours: 4 for CS 436 / 3 for CS 536
• Contact hours: 3
• This course is a 4-credit course, which means that in addition to the scheduled meeting
times, students are expected to do at least 9.5 hours of course-related work outside of
class each week during the semester. This includes time spent completing assigned
readings, participating in lab sessions, studying for tests and examinations, preparing
written assignments, and other course-related tasks.
